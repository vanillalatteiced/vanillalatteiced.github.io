    "content": "Autocorrelation Function (ACF) is autocorrelation as a function of lagged difference. So obviously, at lag $0$, ACF is always $1$. This trivial result is disregarded. ACF includes both direct correlation and indirect/conditional correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t-k}$. For example, in calculation of ACF for lag $2$, the direct correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t-2}$, as well as the indirect correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t-1}$ and between $X_{t-1}$ and $X_{t-2}$, all contribute to the ACF. ACF is symmetric for positive and negative lags, so only positive lags are plotted. Periodicity of ACF . ACF of a periodic process has the same periodicity as the original process. Therefore there can be repeating patterns in ACF (take a look at the correlogram above). Additive property . For two periodic process $X_t$ and $Y_t$, $ACF(X_t + Y_t) = ACF(X_t) + ACF(Y_t)$. Identifying stationarity with ACF . For stationary process, ACF quickly decays to $0$ as lag increases. If it does not, the process is non-stationary. In that case you should try things like plotting the ACF of the differenced data (remove trend). Statistical significance of sample ACF . Correlograms are often plotted with bands which indicate the critical values for statistical significance of AC. Due to randomness in the data, we rarely get exactly zero for AC. Even for white noise data, we get non-zero values even though there is no autocorrelation between the data points. Therefore, for some significance level, ACs that fall within the confidence interval are considered to be $0$ and thus not statistically significant. Standard normal white noise . For standard normal white noise . \\[X_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\] theoretically AC is expected to be $0$. So the 95 confidence interval for AC is . \\[0 \\pm {1.96} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\] where $n$ is the sample size or the length of time series. Although this calculation is based on the assumptions of standard normality (standard error of the mean is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$), seems like it is quite often used as a test of randomness on other time series data as well. Without enough sample size, this test becomes too conservative. General hypothesis test . In general, the statistical significance of AC under the null hypothesis that AC is zero (there is no correlation) and significance level $\\alpha$ is estimated with: . $$ \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\times SE(\\hat{\\rho}(k)) $$ . where $\\hat{\\rho}(k)$ is the sample autocorrelation at lag $k$. The standard error depends on the actual sample AC of the data and there are approximation methods to estimate it. These are usually represented by shaded areas in ACF plots. ",

    "content": "Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) is basically ACF with the indirect/conditional correlation removed. Unlike ACF, PACF only considers the direct correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t-k}$. PACF controls other intermediate lags by including them as regressors. For example, for lag $2$, PACF fits the following regression model: . \\[y_t = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 y_{t-1} + \\beta_2 y_{t-2} + \\epsilon_t\\] Then outpus $\\beta_2$ as the PACF for lag $2$, the direct effect of $y_{t-2}$ on $y_t$. Because of this, PACF is used as a heuristic to determine the order of AR models. However, this heuristic can be used only if data is stationary. For data with a lot of random noise, PACF gets harder to interpret because it won’t diminish. PACF is not periodic . Unlike ACF which carries the periodicity of the original process, PACF does not carry this redundancy. Therefore sum of two periodic processes is not additive unlike ACF. Identifying non-stationarity with PACF . For a trending non-stationary process, the value at lag $1$ is often positive and large and the values at other lags are not statistically significant. This can be interpreted as that the only thing affecting each data point is the previous data point. The previous point contains all the information that is needed to predict the next point, which typically indicates a trend. Statistical significance of sample PACF . It is calculated in the same way as ACF. ",

    "content": "Imputation . Most common way to fix missing data. Depending on the type of missing data (random or systematic), each following method shows different performance. Whether you include future values in imputation also impacts performance, but needs caution due to lookahead. Forward fill . Fill with the last known value before the missing value. Pros: . | Computationally cheap | Can be easily applied to live-streamed data | . Cons: . | Susceptible to introducing unwanted noise / outliers | . Backward fill goes the opposite way. However, since it is a case of lookahead, it should not be used for prediction training and be used only if it makes sense via domain knowledge. Moving average (MA) . Fill with the average of some window of values near the missing value. Calculation is not limited to arithmetic mean. It can be weighted, geometric, etc. It is also called rolling mean. Whether the window should include future values is up to discretion. Including future values is a case of lookahead, but it does improve the estimation of the missing value. One suggestion is to include future values for visualization and exploration, but exclude them for prediction training. Pros: . | Good for noisy data | . Cons: . | Moving average reduces variance. So it must be kept in mind when evaluating model accuracy with $R^2$ or other error statistics because it leads to overestimation of model performance. | . Using total mean to fill missing values is often not a good choice for time series data although it is common for some other data analysis. Also, it is again a case of a lookahead. Interpolation . Using nearby neighbors to decide how missing point should behave. What defines a neighbor is up to decision. For example, linear interpolation uses neighbors to constrain missing point to a linear fit. Just like moving average, you want to decide whether to include future values in imputation. Pros: . | Interpolation is especially useful if you know how the data behaves or prior knowledge about the data (e.g. trend, seasonality). | . Cons: . | If you don’t have prior knowledge or it doesn’t make sense to expect a known behavior, it’s not very helpful. | . When is interpolation better than moving average? As previously mentioned, interpolation is useful if you have prior knowledge. For example if you know there is an upward trend, using moving average will systematically underestimate the missing value. Interpolation can avoid this. Delete data with missing values . Aside from imputation, you could also decide not to use portions of data with missing values. It is not desirable because you would lose that much data, but it is a valid option if you have to patch up too many missing values. ",

Prediction . Simplest form of prediction comes from smoothing data. Mean reversion . Mean reversion is a financial theory that states that even though price seems to deviate in the short term, it eventually remains close to its long-term mean.

    "content": "Moving average . See above . Exponential smoothing . It is similar to a weighted moving average, but it differs in that it gives more weight to recent data points and less weight to older data points. It also differs from moving average in that it uses all past data points (aggregated in a single forecast value) unlike moving average which uses only a window of data points. The simplest form of exponential smoothing is as follows: . Given some smoothing factor $\\alpha$, the simplest smoothed value $S_t$ at time $t$ is defined as: . $$ \\begin{cases} S_0 = y_0 \\\\[1em] S_t = \\alpha y_t + (1 - \\alpha) S_{t-1} \\end{cases} $$ . With direct substitution, this recursion expands to weights of . \\[1, 1 - \\alpha, (1 - \\alpha)^2, (1 - \\alpha)^3, \\dots\\] And past values are associated with higher order weights making them less significant. Hence the name exponential smoothing. Simple exponential smoothing doesn’t work well on data with a trend. Use Holt’s Method for data with trend and Holt-Winters for data with trend and seasonality.

For example, if the data is skewed, the mean will be greatly affected by the outliers. Therefore it is important to understand the distribution of the data with the help of a histogram, before using the representative value to understand the data. Mean . The mean is the average of the data. Also called the sample mean or the arithmetic mean. For a quantitative variable $x$ with a sample of size $n$, the mean is: . $$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i $$ . We use the bar above $\\bar{x}$ to denote the mean of a sample.

You may be wondering why we divide by $n-1$ instead of $n$. Refer to this link for details. But in short, it is to make the sample variance an unbiased estimator of the population variance. Division by $n$ is good enough when we’re only measuring the dispersion in descriptive statistics, but when we’re using the statistic to estimate the population parameter in inferential statistics, it results in an underestimation of the population variance/standard deviation. To emphasize that the statistic comes from a sample, we sometimes call it the sample variance. Some interesting properties of the variance/standard deviation: . | $s^2 \\geq 0$ | $s^2 = 0$ if and only if all values are the same | Higher the dispersion, higher the variance | . Standard Deviation . The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. $$ s = \\sqrt{s^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\tag{unbiased standard deviation} $$ . Population standard deviation is denoted by $\\sigma$. ",

    "content": "Box and whisker plot is another common way to visualize the distribution of data. Quartile . A quartile is a value that divides the data into four equal parts. To find the quartiles, we first need to sort the data in ascending order. Then, we can find the quartiles as follows: . | The first quartile $Q_1$ divides the data into the bottom 25%. | The second quartile $Q_2$ divides the data into the bottom 50%. | This is the same as the median. | . | The third quartile $Q_3$ divides the data into the bottom 75%. | . Box . The box in the box and whisker plot is a rectangle that shows the quartiles. The length of the box is the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third and first quartiles: . $$ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 $$ . The median is shown as a line inside the box. Whiskers . The whiskers in the box and whisker plot are the lines that extend from the box. The ends of the whiskers end at an observed data point. There are many different ways to define the whiskers. One way to draw the whiskers is to extend them to the minimum and maximum values. Another way is to extend them to the values that are within 1.5 times the IQR, and all other values are considered outliers. Whiskers are not always drawn in the same way. They may be even or uneven depending on the definition and data. Outliers . An outlier is a data point that is far away from the rest of the data. There is really no single definition of what an outlier exactly is. It could be points that are outside the whiskers, or data points that are more than 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean.

One security hole of Vault was that the root initializer receives a raw text of all these keys. Therefore, a recommended practice is that you encrypt these keys using a PGP key. Have a PGP key for each piece of the key. GnuPG . One way to do acquire a PGP key is with GnuPG. # Follow prompts to create a PGP key gpg --full-generate-key # Export to disk as base64 gpg --export &lt;key-id&gt; | base64 &gt; my-name.asc .

In Amazon Route 53, this ELB URL has a CNAME Record to the environment URL. This ELB sits in front of EC2 instances in a Auto Scaling Group (ASG). The stack on EC2 instances depends on which platform you chose (eg. Python 3.8 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2). However, in each instance sits one common component called the host manager (HM). HM manages all sorts of monitoring, deploying, and metrics related to the instance. By default, EC2 instances are placed in a security group which allows all connection through port 80 (HTTP). Additional security groups maybe configured as needed. Worker Environment . Key resources launched in EB container: . | SQS | EC2 (Auto Scaling Group), Sqsd | Cloudwatch | . Worker environment is usually set up for long running tasks to run in the background. A worker environment sets up an Amazon SQS queue.

The daemon reads the message from the SQS queue and sends it as an HTTP POST request to the processing application. Upon a 200 OK response from the processing application, Sqsd sends a delete message call to SQS. EC2 instances publish their metrics to Amazon Cloudwatch.

However, there is no downtime unlike ‘All at once’, but the entire deployment process takes a longer time. Rolling with additional batch .

Draw samples from $\\hat{F}_n$ and calculate the statistic of interest, aggregate the results and calculate the sample variance of these resamples (bootstrap samples). Then we argue that the sample variance of the bootstrap samples is a good estimate variance of the sample distribution $T_n$ (see below).

The first comes from the approximation of the true distribution with the empirical distribution function: . $$ \\Var(T(F)) \\approx \\Var(T(\\hat{F}_n)) $$ . Using a slightly different notation $T(F)$ is a statistical functional of the CDF $F$, and $T(\\hat{F}_n)$ is the plug-in estimator using the eCDF.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? . Usually you just end up typing yes, which adds the fingerprint to ~/.ssh/known_hosts and you never see the prompt again.

We want to pick the feature that gives us the most information about the label. For that we need an understanding of entropy and mutual information. In short, entropy is the expected amount of information needed, and mutual information is the amount of information gain on one variable when we are given another, measured in terms of entropy. Let $Y$ be the label and $X_i$ be the $i$-th feature. For each feature $X_i$, we can calculate the mutual information between $X_i$ and $Y$. Higher mutual information means that $X_i$ is more informative about $Y$, which is what we want. \\[\\underset{X_i}{\\arg\\max} \\; I(Y; X_i) = \\underset{X_i}{\\arg\\max} \\; H(Y) - H(Y \\mid X_i)\\] Caveat One caveat is that mutual information is biased towards features with more partition. For two features ID and gender, while there are many distinct values that ID can take on, gender only has so many. So when you split on a feature with many distinct values (quantitative or not), we need to penalize by the number of splits and use a metric called information gain ratio, or just partition on a reasonable range.

The above documentation describes the need for two containers, one is a DinD (Docker in Docker) container and the other is the master Jenkins container. The DinD container is used to enable Docker in the Jenkins container. This is accomplished by placing both containers in the same network and exposing the DinD TLS port (2376). It is recommended to map both volumes jenkins-docker-certs and jenkins-data to the host filesystem to persist the data between container restarts. For the Jenkins container, the documentation recommends two ports to be exposed: 8080 for the web UI and 50000 for the slave agent. However, if you are planning to use SSH agents you do not need to expose the 50000 port. Disble built-in node executors on initialization . This is a recommendation described in the Github documentation. Because you generally want to use agents to run your builds, it is advised to set number of executors in the built-in node to zero. You can do so by creating executors.groovy, . // executors.groovy import jenkins.model.* Jenkins.instance.setNumExecutors(0) . And a Dockerfile extending the jenkins/jenkins image, . # Dockerfile FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11 COPY --chown=jenkins:jenkins executors.groovy /usr/share/jenkins/ref/init.groovy.d/executors.groovy .

    "content": "If you are used to relational database schemas, it is easy to end up designing your database to use multiple tables, to structure logical joins using foreign key-like attribute and what not, or to use multi-level nested structure. However, in NoSQL, all these familiar patterns are not only inefficient, but also almost impossible to manage. There really is no such thing as a schema design in DynamoDB but a careful design of primary key is useful. Primary Key . There are two types of keys that can consist a primary key in DynamoDB: partition (hash) key and sort (range) key. A primary key could just consist of a partition key or be a compound of partition and sort key. Because each item is identified by a unique primary key, you must use a unique partition key if your primary key only consists of it. However, if you also use the sort key, the partition key may overlap but the sort key must be unique. Partition key and sort key are also called hash and range keys. The naming indicates that the partition key serves as a hashed index to a physical storage internal unit called a partition. The sort key sorts the items within a partition into groups of similar items, effectively providing an efficient way to query for a range. Hence, design of primary key has an impact on the performance of the DB. Design . In relational databases, primary keys are usually a single attribute (like StudentID) of a homogeneous type. However, in DynamoDB it is common to use a multi-purpose (or heterogeneous) key attributes. Typically, every item is given an attribute called PK and SK for partition and sort key. This way the key attributes may contain any information without restriction. ",

Bootstrap sampling . Given $n$ observations, we randomly sample a subset with replacement. We repeat this process $k$ times to get $k$ independent subsets. Allowing replacement is critical to make each sample independent. Aggregating . We train a model on each of the $k$ subsets and then combine the result. ",

Also known as relative entropy of $P$ with respect to $Q$, or how much extra surprise we get if we use $Q$ instead of $P$. Most common scenario is to compare the difference between the empirical distribution of the observations and the theoretical model distribution.

Intuitive way to remember this is to calculate the ratio of the probabilities of observing random variable $X$ under $P$ and $Q$: . \\[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\] Then we take the log of this ratio: . \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\right)\\] This aligns with our intuition that we want to measure the statistical difference between the two distributions, because it is equal to the logarithmic difference $\\log(p(x)) - \\log(q(x))$.

Algebraically, it is easy to see that $D_{KL}(P\\mathbin{||}Q) \\neq D_{KL}(Q\\mathbin{||}P)$. Intuitive way to remember Remeber that we can think of $P$ as the observed distribution and $Q$ as the theoretical model distribution. We usually want to estimate a model parameter that can minimize the difference with the observed distribution. But a model cannot always perfectly fit the observed distribution, but it will try its best. But two distributions may have different ideas on what counts as “best”. Maybe $P$ has a lot of bumps or outbursts, which may be important because they are caused by relevant events. However, a model distribution might have a tendency to flatten out the bumps and outbursts because it wants to generalize. For $D_{KL}(P\\mathbin{||}Q)$, we are looking at the difference from the empirical distribution perspective. When $P$ looks at $Q$, it may think the difference is big because they did not capture the important information, like the bump. For $D_{KL}(Q\\mathbin{||}P)$, we are looking at the difference from the model perspective. When $Q$ looks at $P$, it may think the difference is small because the mean is similar and the bumps are not important. ",

    "title": "SPA vs SSR vs Static Site",
    "content": "Here is an attempt to understand the exact differences between the three. Single-Page Application (SPA) . An SPA uses CSR (client-side rendering). Just by that I can already see the glaring difference to SSR (server-side rendering). In CSR, as the name suggests the client (browser) dynamically renders the web app. All the HTML, CSS, and Javascript are loaded in the beginning of the app’s lifecycle. Script makes AJAX calls to the API when it needs new data and dynamically integrates it. So technically, there really is only one page that is being presented to the user, it’s just that the contents within the page change to meet your needs. One advantage of SPA is that it provides better UX, because there is little to no lag time during navigation within the app. This comes from the fact that SPA does not require duplicate resources again and again after each click unlike MPA (Multiple-Page Application)/SSR. Things that always stay static on a website, like the general frame or style can stay as is and only new data are fetched from server. One disadvantage is that it is generally considered to have poor SEO (Search-Engine Optimization) compared to server-side apps. This is because without JS rendering, the HTML of an SPA is pretty much empty. If you check the source code of an SPA (not from the console), you will see that it does not contain much other than all the scripts that are sitting and waiting to execute upon interaction. In addition, SPAs might not have unique URLs for each content delivered. In many cases the URL stays the same throughout the entire site. Therefore crawling and indexing becomes slow and difficult. Server-Side Rendering . With all that being said about SPA, SSR is easier to understand. When navigation happens (e.g via click), the server builds the page and hands it over to the browser. Within a browser, you will only see the resources that consist the current page that you are on. You can already see why this could be slow, since it’s like asking the chef to dip your nachos every single bite when you could’ve just had the chips and cheese in front of you and dip it yourself. Due to this nature of SSR, you will see the page flicker upon navigation unlike the smooth UX of SPA. However, the benefit of SSR compared to SPA is that it is more secure, less heavy on the browser (and no memory leaks), and better SEO. Static Site . Static sites do not have dynamic content and consist of only the static files (HTML, CSS, JS). You could think of this as if the SSR had already rendered every single page that the client might request and had it prepared for you. There is no backend component to static sites and no rendering is involved. ",

When I first read about OAuth, I thought, “Well isn’t this the ‘Sign in with Google/Facebook’ button that I see quite a lot on websites these days?”. It sort of is, because the protocol behind that button is OpenID which is built on top of OAuth 2.0. So the way they operate are very similar, but it is good to know the difference that OAuth is for authorization and OpenID builds a layer on top of OAuth for authentication. ",

    "title": "Client types",
    "content": "There are two different types of clients in OAuth. One is a public client and the other is a confidential client. To understand the difference, you need to know the term client secret. Client secret . A client secret is nothing more than a random string generated. It is usually created by generating a secure random string of 256-bit (32 bytes) and then converting it to hex. This value should never be revealed to the outside except for the authorizing server and the client app. Hence the name ‘client secret’. Inside your code, client secret will be used to successfully authorize users. But the issue that arises is where should the client store this secret. Public clients . If the client cannot keep the client secret a secret, it is called a public client. For example, single-page apps that expose everything on the browser with no backend or mobile apps that can have their HTTPS request intercepted and revealed are considered public clients. In case of an SPA, everything is exposed on the browser. Chrome inspect will reveal the source code, local storage, session, and cookies. So storing client secret is infeasible. For a mobile app, apparently it is possible to provide a fake HTTPS certificate that goes to your own API. So you can catch an HTTPS leaving the phone, route it to a different API, have that API make a request to the initial intended API, and return the response to phone as if it would normally, while the proxy API in the middle can inspect all the requests (which may contain the client secret at some point). Confidential clients . This is typically a traditional web server or anything backed by a server where nobody can take a peek at the source code or have the requests intercepted. ",

The general process is as below: . | Client sends request to autorization server | Client gets an authorization code back | Client sends request to a token endpoint | Client gets an access token | Client places this token in a header when sending a request to resource server | . Implicit flow . Implicit flow is much more simplified. After step 1, implicit flow skips right to step 4. Because the access token is revealed on the browser url, this is considered an insecure lecay method. Authorization code flow . Client gets an authorization code back as a request parameter embedded in the url. The client then uses this code to exchange it for an access token. Usually secure random strings such as state and client secret are used to validate the process. Authorization code flow with PKCE . For public clients that cannot keep any secret strings, PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) is implemented. This step includes an additional code challenge and verifying step. ",

If you’re not using rbenv this is indeed more desirable as it installs your gems to your home directory (like ~/.gem). However, for my purpose and with rbenv it was unnecessary. As you’ll notice by inspecting the gem env outputs, the global install directory (INSTALLATION DIRECTORY) is already in your home directory (~/.rbenv/versions/...). On the other hand, the user install directory (USER INSTALLATION DIRECTORY) is set to some local folder (~/.local/share/gem/ruby/...).

In the case of the figure above, the objective function is $f(x,y)$ and the constraint is $g(x,y) = c$. Very rough idea is as follows: . Out of the many level curves $f(x,y) = d$ can take, we want to pick the one with maximum or minimum $d$. Since we have a constraint, we can only expand or shrink the curve until it touches the constraint $g(x,y) = c$. There should be a point where both curves become tangent to each other. At this tangent, $f(x,y)$ is at a local extreme while satisfying the constraint. The gradient vector $\\nabla f(x,y)$ is orthogal to its tangent vector, and so is the gradient vector $\\nabla g(x,y)$ to its tangent vector. Although they may be in opposite directions and/or different magnitudes, both gradient vectors are aligned. In the figure above, they are the blue dotted line vector and the red line vector at the tangent point facing opposite directions. If we scale the gradient vector $\\nabla g(x,y)$ by a constant $\\lambda$, we can make it equal to the gradient vector $\\nabla f(x,y)$. $$ \\nabla f(x,y) = \\lambda \\nabla g(x,y) \\quad \\Rightarrow\\quad \\nabla f(x,y) - \\lambda \\nabla g(x,y) = 0 $$ .

However, once we see a repeated character, the starting point of the window needs to be moved to the right until the last occurrence of the repeated character is no longer in the window. \\[\\fbox{abcde} \\mbox{fd} \\implies \\fbox{abcdef} \\mbox{d} \\implies \\mbox{abcd} \\fbox{efd}\\] So, we should to keep track of the last occurrence of each character. I will be using a HashMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; to do this, where each character is mapped to its index of last occurrence. HashMap&lt;Character, Integer&gt; seen = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); int maxLen = 0; // Max found so far int curLen = 0; // Size of current window for (int j = 0; j &lt; s.length(); j++) { Character c = s.charAt(j); if (seen.containsKey(c)) { // Found a repeated character int i = seen.get(c); // Retrieve index of last occurrence if (j - curLen &gt; i) { // If last occurrence is not within window curLen++; } else { curLen = j - (i + 1) + 1; // Calculate new window size } seen.replace(c, j); // Update last occurrence } else { curLen++; // Expand window seen.put(c, j); // Record last occurrence } maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, curLen); } return maxLen; . Everything is straightforward except for: . if (j - curLen &gt; i) { // If last occurrence is not within window curLen++; } else { curLen = j - (i + 1) + 1; // Calculate new window size } . What is the if statement doing? . Take the example of abbcda. When we see the last a at index 5, the window looks like . \\[\\mbox{ab} \\fbox{bcd} \\mbox{a}\\] The window should now ignore everything before the second b, but the HashMap still has a -&gt; 0 in it. Calculating j - (i + 1) + 1 will give us the wrong window of . \\[\\fbox{abbcda}\\] so we have to make the window ignore everything outside of current window. ",

This $x$ will divide each array into two parts: . \\[\\begin{gather*} A_{left} \\mid A_{right} \\\\ B_{left} \\mid B_{right} \\end{gather*}\\] where $A_{left}$ and $B_{left}$ consist of respective elements $\\le x$, and $A_{right}$ and $B_{right}$ consist of respective elements $\\gt x$. For $x$ to be the median of the two sorted arrays, the following conditions must be satisfied: . | $\\max(A_{left}) \\le \\min(B_{right})$ and $\\max(B_{left}) \\le \\min(A_{right})$ | If $m + n$ is odd, then $|A_{left}| + |B_{left}| = |A_{right}| + |B_{right}| + 1$. If $m + n$ is even, then $|A_{left}| + |B_{left}| = |A_{right}| + |B_{right}|$ . | . Let $i$ be the number of elements in $A_{left}$, and $j$ be the number of elements in $B_{left}$. The first condition can be rewritten as: . \\[a_{i - 1} \\le b_j \\wedge b_{j - 1} \\le a_i\\] The notation follows the coding convention of 0-based indexing.

We see that $j$ is predetermined by $i$, so our problem boils down to finding the right $i$ that satisfies the first condition.

Because we know the left side has one more element which is the median. | Why $\\operatorname{avg}(\\max(a_{i-1}, b_{j-1}), \\min(a_{i}, b_{j}))$ for even $m + n$? .

Because we use a t-distribution, we need to assume the normality of the population. For some value $m$, our null hypothesis would be: . $$ H_0: \\mu = m $$ . And our alternative hypothesis: . $$ H_A: \\mu \\ne m $$ . If $p &lt; \\alpha$, we would conclude that the population mean is unlikely to be $m$. It is important to note that the value $m$ must be selected so that it serves as a meaningful value to the researcher (there should be a reason why we chose $m$). For example, if we were testing for the population’s average height, there’s no point in just choosing $m = 170cm$, because that’s an arbitrary value. In this case, we are actually better off just calculating a confidence interval for the population mean. However, if there was a better reasoning behind $m = 170cm$ (such as, average height in a certain country was 170cm and we want to test if it is the same in this country), then our hypothesis test would be more meaningful.

    "content": "Paired t-test is a hypothesis test that compares the means of two populations that are related in some way. Most common case is comparing the data of identical subjects before and after a treatment. This might seem like a new testing method, but it is actually just a special case of one-sample t-test. Instead of setting up a null hypothesis on the population mean, we set up a null hypothesis on the difference between the means before/after. Consider the following table: . | Subject | Before | After | Difference | . | A | 10 | 12 | 2 | . | B | 10 | 14 | 4 | . | C | 12 | 14 | 2 | . | D | 11 | 15 | 4 | . Let $X_0$ be the population of the data before the treatment, and $X_1$ be the population of the data after the treatment. Then our null hypothesis would be on the $\\Delta X = X_1 - X_0$: . $$ H_0: \\mu_{\\Delta X} = 0 $$ . I won’t go into the details of the calculation, but following the same steps as one-sample t-test, you will find that our difference in the table above is significantly different from 0 (with $\\alpha = 0.05$). You may wonder if we can just use a two-sample t-test (described below) to compare the means before/after. However, the problem is that the samples are not independent of each other, and this makes the two-sample t-test more prone to errors.

    "content": "If the model captures all the variation in the dependent variable, the variation caused by error ($SS_{res}$) is zero, which would make $R^2$ equal to 1. This indicates that the model perfectly fits the data. The baseline model, which is just the mean of the dependent variable, results in $R^2$ equal to 0. Any model that performs worse than the baseline model will have a negative $R^2$. $$ \\begin{gather*} R^2 = 1 \\Rightarrow \\text{perfect fit} \\\\ R^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{baseline model} \\\\ R^2 &lt; 0 \\Rightarrow \\text{worse than baseline model} \\end{gather*} $$ . So generally, the higher the $R^2$ the better the model fits the data. Anything below 0 means you should really reconsider your model or check if you have a mistake, because you’re doing worse than the bare minimum which is just always predicting the mean. Just because a model has a high $R^2$ doesn’t mean it’s a good model. $R^2$ is not a good measure for non-linear models, because the sum of squares decomposition doesn’t hold for them. ",

Let $\\mathbf{x}_{+1}$ be the support vector that satisfies . \\[\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_{+1} + b = 1\\] Let $d$ be the distance from this support vector to the hyperplane. We know that $\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert}$ is the unit vector normal to the hyperplane. If we start at $\\mathbf{x}_{+1}$ and move along the negative direction of this unit vector by $d$, we will reach the hyperplane: . \\[\\mathbf{w}^T \\left( \\mathbf{x}_{+1} - d \\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert} \\right) + b = 0 \\\\\\] We want to solve for $d$: . \\[\\begin{gather*} \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_{+1} - d \\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert} + b = 0 \\tag{Dot product} \\\\ \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_{+1} - d \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert + b = 0 \\\\ d \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert = \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_{+1} + b \\\\ d \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert = 1 \\tag{By definition} \\\\ d = \\frac{1}{\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert} \\end{gather*}\\] Since the margin is twice the distance $d$, . $$ \\frac{2}{\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert} $$ . We instead solve a minimization problem of: . $$ \\begin{gather*} \\min_{\\mathbf{w}, b} \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2 \\quad s.t.\\quad y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b) \\geq 1 \\end{gather*} $$ . We use $\\frac{1}{2} \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2$ instead of $\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert$ just so that the derivative is easier to calculate. This primal problem can be solved using Lagrange multipliers. Soft margin SVC . In reality, the data are not always linearly separable with a hard margin. We can relax the constraint to allow some mistakes, but instead penalize the misclassification. To account for the misclassifications, we introduce a slack variable $\\xi_i \\ge 0$ for each observation: . $$ \\xi_i \\approx \\max(0, 1 - y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b)) $$ . The right side of the $\\approx$ is called the hinge loss. We use the approximate sign because the slack variable is not exactly the hinge loss, but some constant times the hinge loss. Geometrically, $\\xi_i$ captures the distance from the correct side of the margin defined by the support vectors to the observation, which is an intuitive penalty for misclassification. For correctly classified observations, $\\xi_i = 0$, and for greatly misclassified observations $\\xi_i$ gets bigger. With this slack variable, we now have a new constraint: . \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b &amp;\\geq 1 - \\xi_i &amp; \\text{if } y_i = 1 \\\\ \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b &amp;\\leq -1 + \\xi_i &amp; \\text{if } y_i = -1 \\end{align*}\\] This soft-margin contraint can be compactly written as: . \\[y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i\\] Since now we have two things to minimize, the original objective in addition to the sum of the slack variables, so we solve the following minimization problem: . $$ \\min_{\\mathbf{w}, b, \\xi} \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_i \\quad s.t.\\quad y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i $$ . where $C$ is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between having a large, complex model (added $\\xi_i$) and allowing more mistakes. | With a huge $C$, we are essentially solving a hard-margin problem. | Because in attempt to minimize the slack sum with a huge $C$, we will end up allowing slacks of near-zero values which is as rigid as a hard-margin. | . | With a small $C$, we are giving more rooms for slack during the minimization. | .

Let feature map $\\Phi$ be a non-linear transformation that maps the data from a lower-dimensional input space to a higher-dimensional feature space. $$ \\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^q \\quad \\text{where}\\quad q &gt; p $$ . Cover's theorem Cover’s theorem states that a linearly non-separable dataset in a lower-dimensional space may be linearly separable in a higher-dimensional space. Kernel $K(\\cdot)$ is a function that satisfies the following: . $$ K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)^T \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_j) \\quad \\forall \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^p $$ . In other words, the kernel function is a function that given any two vectors in the input space, computes the dot product of them in the feature space. Loose intuition In the usual input space, the optimal solution given by the Lagrange multiplier method involves calculating the dot product of the observations $\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\mathbf{x}_j$. Since we now inflate the input space to a higher-dimensional feature space, we need to calculate the dot product of the observations in the feature space. So in order to replace the inner product of inputs, we need to find a kernel that can compute the dot product of the observations in the feature space for all possible pairs of observations. One key point is that as long as we can find a kernel with output that lives in the inner product space, we don’t have to have an explicitly defined feature map $\\Phi$. Radial basis function (RBF) kernel . Most commonly used kernel for SVC is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The RBF kernel is defined as: . \\[K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j \\rVert^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right)\\] $\\sigma$ is a free variable that controls the flexibility of the decision boundary. Oftentimes, we define . \\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2}\\] Again, $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the denominator is just for convenience. You may find $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$ in other sources. so that the RBF kernel is defined as: . $$ K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\exp \\left( -\\gamma \\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j \\rVert^2 \\right) $$ . | Low $\\gamma$: decision boundary is less flexible, more linear | High $\\gamma$: decision boundary is more flexible | .

    "title": "Relation to Inner Product",
    "content": "Any general inner product can be represented as a matrix multiplication. The matrix that uniquely defines the inner product is called the symmetric, positive definite matrix. Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional inner product space with inner product $\\langle\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle: V \\times V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Let $B = (\\mathbf{b}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_n)$ be an ordered basis of $V$. Any vector $\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y} \\in V$ can be represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors: . \\[\\mathbf{x} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i \\mathbf{b}_i \\quad\\quad\\quad \\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\psi_j \\mathbf{b}_j\\] for some $\\lambda_i, \\psi_j \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Also, let $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} = [\\lambda_1 \\dots \\lambda_n]^T$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = [\\psi_1 \\dots \\psi_n]^T$, which are the coordinate vectors of $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ with respect to the ordered basis $B$. Often also denoted $[\\mathbf{x}]_B$ and $[\\mathbf{y}]_B$. See coordinate vectors with respect to orderded bases. The inner product $\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle$ have three properties: . | Bilinear | Symmetric | Positive definite | . First using bilinearity: . \\[\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\left\\langle\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i \\mathbf{b}_i, \\sum_{j=1}^n \\psi_j \\mathbf{b}_j\\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\lambda_i \\langle\\mathbf{b}_i, \\mathbf{b}_j\\rangle \\psi_j = \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\] $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}$ are just coordinates, so $\\mathbf{A}$ is the matrix that uniquely defines the inner product operation. Because an inner product is symmetric, $\\mathbf{A}$ is also a symmetric matrix. Now using positive definiteness: . \\[\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:posdef} \\tag{Positive Definite} \\forall \\mathbf{x} \\in V\\setminus\\{\\mathbf{0}\\},\\, \\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x} &gt; 0 \\end{equation}\\] Such $\\mathbf{A}$ is called the symmetric, positive definite matrix. Hence, $\\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle$ is a valid inner product if and only if there exists a symmetric, positive definite matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ such that . $$ \\langle\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{y}\\rangle = \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}^T \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} $$ . Again, remember that $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ are coordinate vectors of each respect to the ordered basis $B$. ",

It is important to note that a solution is not limited to just moving the disk from the source peg to the target peg. It is a solution that can be used to move the disk from one peg to another peg (given the help of the auxiliary peg). Now what if there was actually a larger second disk at the bottom of the source peg? . Since this is the largest disk, it does not invalidate our previous solution. We can still use our solution for the single disk, so that one disk is now on the auxiliary peg. Then, we can move the second disk (the largest disk) from the source peg to the target peg. It is important to understand that once you’ve moved the current largest disk to the target peg, it essentially disappears from the problem as if it was never there in the first place. Now we have a single disk on the auxiliary peg, which means we can use our base case solution to move the disk to the target peg. Then we have solved the problem for two disks. There exists a way to move the two disks from one peg to another peg in the same sorted order. What if there was actually a third disk at the bottom of the initial source peg? . For the top two disks, we can use the previous solution to move them to the auxiliary peg. Then we move the third disk (largest disk) from the source peg to the target peg. Since the largest disk is on the target peg, it disappears from the problem. Now we have two disks on the auxiliary peg, we can use the previous solution to move them to the target peg. Then we have solved the problem for three disks. With $n$ disks, the same thing happens. We move the top $n-1$ disks to the auxiliary peg, using a previous solution. We move the largest disk left on the source peg to the target peg. Then this target peg disappears from the problem. We can move the $n-1$ disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg, because we’re back to our previous case of $n-1$ disks. ",

    "content": "First navigate to ~/.ssh. For organization, create a directory and name it github. All private and public keys for GitHub connection will be placed here. Generate a new SSH key . Follow the ssh-keygen prompt. It will ask you to decide on a name for the file, passphrase, etc. # If Ed25519 algorithm is supported ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your_github@email.com\" . # Legacy RSA ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_github@email.com\" . Add the new SSH key to GitHub account . Easiest part. Refer to GitHub documentation for step-by-step screencaps. Modify config . Suppose I have two GitHub accounts each associated with personal_email@address.com and work_email@address.com. I’ll assume the private keys are named github-personal and github-work respectively. Now append the following to ~/.ssh/config . Host github-personal HostName github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github/github-personal Host github-work HostName github.com User git IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github/github-work . You can define custom host for both as such or have one of them keep the default github.com. Local config per repository . First start a local repo with . git init . Then config local name and email that will be used for that repo . git config --local user.name \"work_name\" git config --local user.email \"work_email@address.com\" . Add remote . Normally you would add an ssh remote by . git remote add origin git@github.com:github_username:repo_name # OR git remote add origin github.com:github_username:repo_name . But this time, . git remote add origin github-work:work_username:repo_name . References: . | GitHub: SSH | . ",
