It is clear that the difference is more prominent in situation B, because there is more variation between the red bar, and less variation within the blue dots.

Therefore it is important to understand the distribution of the data with the help of a histogram, before using the representative value to understand the data. Mean .

Box . The box in the box and whisker plot is a rectangle that shows the quartiles. The length of the box is the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third and first quartiles: . $$ IQR = Q_3 - Q_1 $$ . The median is shown as a line inside the box. Whiskers . The whiskers in the box and whisker plot are the lines that extend from the box. The ends of the whiskers end at an observed data point. There are many different ways to define the whiskers. One way to draw the whiskers is to extend them to the minimum and maximum values. Another way is to extend them to the values that are within 1.5 times the IQR, and all other values are considered outliers. Whiskers are not always drawn in the same way. They may be even or uneven depending on the definition and data. Outliers . An outlier is a data point that is far away from the rest of the data.

Web server environment is given a URL of myapp.region.elasticbeanstalk.com. This environment creates an Elastic Load Balancer with a URL of of elb-id.region.elb.amazonaws.com. In Amazon Route 53, this ELB URL has a CNAME Record to the environment URL. This ELB sits in front of EC2 instances in a Auto Scaling Group (ASG). The stack on EC2 instances depends on which platform you chose (eg. Python 3.8 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2). However, in each instance sits one common component called the host manager (HM). HM manages all sorts of monitoring, deploying, and metrics related to the instance. By default, EC2 instances are placed in a security group which allows all connection through port 80 (HTTP). Additional security groups maybe configured as needed. Worker Environment . Key resources launched in EB container: . | SQS | EC2 (Auto Scaling Group), Sqsd | Cloudwatch | . Worker environment is usually set up for long running tasks to run in the background. A worker environment sets up an Amazon SQS queue. This queue often consists of messages from a web server environment. On each EC2 instance runs a Sqsd daemon and a processing application. The daemon reads the message from the SQS queue and sends it as an HTTP POST request to the processing application. Upon a 200 OK response from the processing application, Sqsd sends a delete message call to SQS. EC2 instances publish their metrics to Amazon Cloudwatch. Auto Scaling retrieves usage data from Cloudwatch and scales instances accordingly. ",

However, there is no downtime unlike ‘All at once’, but the entire deployment process takes a longer time. Rolling with additional batch .

Hence, the number of instances up during deployment stays the same. This takes longer time. Immutable . Instead of updating instances, a complete new Auto Scaling Group set of instances is created. This is even slower. Traffic Splitting . Create a new set of instances and test it with a portion of the incoming traffic, while the rest of the traffic is still going to the old deployment version. This is as slow as ‘Immutable’. Blue/Green Deployment Policy . One additional deployment option is the Blue/Green deployment.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? . Usually you just end up typing yes, which adds the fingerprint to ~/.ssh/known_hosts and you never see the prompt again. However, just like the prompt says, are you sure that this site can be trusted? Are you sure that there wasn’t a man in the middle that redirected you to one of his bad machines? . By placing a trusted host CA’s public key on the client before the first SSH, this security risk can be avoided. Configure a host CA . Create a key pair for host CA: . ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"hostca\" -f hostca . Which produces hostca and hostca.pub. vault write ssh-host-signer/config/ca generate_signing_key=true currently only generates rsa keys, which is deprecated in newer OpenSSH. To use different crypto algorithms such as ed25519, you have to generate one and upload it to Vault. Mount the SSH secrets engine on Vault: . vault secrets enable -path=ssh-host-signer ssh . The path can be anything you like, just make sure you are logged in to Vault and has the policy to read/write to that path. Upload the CA key pair: . vault write ssh-host-signer/config/ca \\ private_key=@hostca \\ public_key=@hostca.pub . The @ points to the file. Use \"...\" to copy and paste the values.

Vault uses these roles to sign keys. The above configuration basically says it can sign host certificates for domains of example.com, *.example.com, something.com, *.something.com, and the certificate will be valid for 10 years.

We want to pick the feature that gives us the most information about the label. For that we need an understanding of entropy and mutual information. In short, entropy is the expected amount of information needed, and mutual information is the amount of information gain on one variable when we are given another, measured in terms of entropy. Let $Y$ be the label and $X_i$ be the $i$-th feature. For each feature $X_i$, we can calculate the mutual information between $X_i$ and $Y$. Higher mutual information means that $X_i$ is more informative about $Y$, which is what we want. \\[\\underset{X_i}{\\arg\\max} \\; I(Y; X_i) = \\underset{X_i}{\\arg\\max} \\; H(Y) - H(Y \\mid X_i)\\] Caveat One caveat is that mutual information is biased towards features with more partition. For two features ID and gender, while there are many distinct values that ID can take on, gender only has so many. So when you split on a feature with many distinct values (quantitative or not), we need to penalize by the number of splits and use a metric called information gain ratio, or just partition on a reasonable range.

It comes from the observation that the full determinant expansion can be written as a special sum of products of elements. Explanation assumes expansion along row $i$ for simplicity. The key takeaway is that each recursive product in the sum ends up looking like the following: . \\[\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i\\sigma(i)}\\] That is, while the row $i$ increases from $1$ to $n$ (or is an identity permutation), the column is actually permuted by some $\\sigma$. Like $a_{12} \\cdot a_{23} \\cdot a_{31}$, where the column $j$ is permuted to $2, 3, 1$. In addition, the sign of the recursive product ends up equal to the parity of the permutation $\\sigma$.

The above documentation describes the need for two containers, one is a DinD (Docker in Docker) container and the other is the master Jenkins container. The DinD container is used to enable Docker in the Jenkins container. This is accomplished by placing both containers in the same network and exposing the DinD TLS port (2376). It is recommended to map both volumes jenkins-docker-certs and jenkins-data to the host filesystem to persist the data between container restarts. For the Jenkins container, the documentation recommends two ports to be exposed: 8080 for the web UI and 50000 for the slave agent. However, if you are planning to use SSH agents you do not need to expose the 50000 port. Disble built-in node executors on initialization . This is a recommendation described in the Github documentation. Because you generally want to use agents to run your builds, it is advised to set number of executors in the built-in node to zero. You can do so by creating executors.groovy, . // executors.groovy import jenkins.model.* Jenkins.instance.setNumExecutors(0) . And a Dockerfile extending the jenkins/jenkins image, . # Dockerfile FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11 COPY --chown=jenkins:jenkins executors.groovy /usr/share/jenkins/ref/init.groovy.d/executors.groovy .

However, in NoSQL, all these familiar patterns are not only inefficient, but also almost impossible to manage. There really is no such thing as a schema design in DynamoDB but a careful design of primary key is useful. Primary Key . There are two types of keys that can consist a primary key in DynamoDB: partition (hash) key and sort (range) key. A primary key could just consist of a partition key or be a compound of partition and sort key. Because each item is identified by a unique primary key, you must use a unique partition key if your primary key only consists of it. However, if you also use the sort key, the partition key may overlap but the sort key must be unique. Partition key and sort key are also called hash and range keys. The naming indicates that the partition key serves as a hashed index to a physical storage internal unit called a partition. The sort key sorts the items within a partition into groups of similar items, effectively providing an efficient way to query for a range. Hence, design of primary key has an impact on the performance of the DB. Design . In relational databases, primary keys are usually a single attribute (like StudentID) of a homogeneous type. However, in DynamoDB it is common to use a multi-purpose (or heterogeneous) key attributes. Typically, every item is given an attribute called PK and SK for partition and sort key. This way the key attributes may contain any information without restriction. ",

Intuitive way to remember this is to calculate the ratio of the probabilities of observing random variable $X$ under $P$ and $Q$: . \\[\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\] Then we take the log of this ratio: . \\[\\log\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\\right)\\] This aligns with our intuition that we want to measure the statistical difference between the two distributions, because it is equal to the logarithmic difference $\\log(p(x)) - \\log(q(x))$.

Algebraically, it is easy to see that $D_{KL}(P\\mathbin{||}Q) \\neq D_{KL}(Q\\mathbin{||}P)$. Intuitive way to remember Remeber that we can think of $P$ as the observed distribution and $Q$ as the theoretical model distribution. We usually want to estimate a model parameter that can minimize the difference with the observed distribution. But a model cannot always perfectly fit the observed distribution, but it will try its best. But two distributions may have different ideas on what counts as “best”. Maybe $P$ has a lot of bumps or outbursts, which may be important because they are caused by relevant events. However, a model distribution might have a tendency to flatten out the bumps and outbursts because it wants to generalize. For $D_{KL}(P\\mathbin{||}Q)$, we are looking at the difference from the empirical distribution perspective. When $P$ looks at $Q$, it may think the difference is big because they did not capture the important information, like the bump.

    "content": "Here is an attempt to understand the exact differences between the three. Single-Page Application (SPA) . An SPA uses CSR (client-side rendering). Just by that I can already see the glaring difference to SSR (server-side rendering). In CSR, as the name suggests the client (browser) dynamically renders the web app. All the HTML, CSS, and Javascript are loaded in the beginning of the app’s lifecycle. Script makes AJAX calls to the API when it needs new data and dynamically integrates it. So technically, there really is only one page that is being presented to the user, it’s just that the contents within the page change to meet your needs. One advantage of SPA is that it provides better UX, because there is little to no lag time during navigation within the app. This comes from the fact that SPA does not require duplicate resources again and again after each click unlike MPA (Multiple-Page Application)/SSR. Things that always stay static on a website, like the general frame or style can stay as is and only new data are fetched from server. One disadvantage is that it is generally considered to have poor SEO (Search-Engine Optimization) compared to server-side apps. This is because without JS rendering, the HTML of an SPA is pretty much empty. If you check the source code of an SPA (not from the console), you will see that it does not contain much other than all the scripts that are sitting and waiting to execute upon interaction. In addition, SPAs might not have unique URLs for each content delivered. In many cases the URL stays the same throughout the entire site. Therefore crawling and indexing becomes slow and difficult. Server-Side Rendering . With all that being said about SPA, SSR is easier to understand. When navigation happens (e.g via click), the server builds the page and hands it over to the browser. Within a browser, you will only see the resources that consist the current page that you are on. You can already see why this could be slow, since it’s like asking the chef to dip your nachos every single bite when you could’ve just had the chips and cheese in front of you and dip it yourself. Due to this nature of SSR, you will see the page flicker upon navigation unlike the smooth UX of SPA. However, the benefit of SSR compared to SPA is that it is more secure, less heavy on the browser (and no memory leaks), and better SEO. Static Site . Static sites do not have dynamic content and consist of only the static files (HTML, CSS, JS). You could think of this as if the SSR had already rendered every single page that the client might request and had it prepared for you. There is no backend component to static sites and no rendering is involved. ",

While it sounds intimidating, it is essentially made to ‘let this application access my Google photos’, ‘let this site use my Facebook contacts’, etc. So it was developed as method for authorization to a 3rd party resource. Some terms: . | Resource owner: that’s the user (you) wanting to grant access | Resource server: the API you want to access | Client: application requesting access | User Agent: the thing user is using to talk to client (browser, mobile app) | Authorization server: authorizes and grants access tokens to client | . OpenID . One thing to note is the word authorization, and you shoud not to confuse it with authentication. When I first read about OAuth, I thought, “Well isn’t this the ‘Sign in with Google/Facebook’ button that I see quite a lot on websites these days?”. It sort of is, because the protocol behind that button is OpenID which is built on top of OAuth 2.0.

    "title": "Client types",
    "content": "There are two different types of clients in OAuth. One is a public client and the other is a confidential client. To understand the difference, you need to know the term client secret. Client secret . A client secret is nothing more than a random string generated. It is usually created by generating a secure random string of 256-bit (32 bytes) and then converting it to hex. This value should never be revealed to the outside except for the authorizing server and the client app. Hence the name ‘client secret’. Inside your code, client secret will be used to successfully authorize users. But the issue that arises is where should the client store this secret. Public clients . If the client cannot keep the client secret a secret, it is called a public client. For example, single-page apps that expose everything on the browser with no backend or mobile apps that can have their HTTPS request intercepted and revealed are considered public clients. In case of an SPA, everything is exposed on the browser. Chrome inspect will reveal the source code, local storage, session, and cookies. So storing client secret is infeasible. For a mobile app, apparently it is possible to provide a fake HTTPS certificate that goes to your own API. So you can catch an HTTPS leaving the phone, route it to a different API, have that API make a request to the initial intended API, and return the response to phone as if it would normally, while the proxy API in the middle can inspect all the requests (which may contain the client secret at some point). Confidential clients . This is typically a traditional web server or anything backed by a server where nobody can take a peek at the source code or have the requests intercepted. ",

Implicit flow . Implicit flow is much more simplified. After step 1, implicit flow skips right to step 4. Because the access token is revealed on the browser url, this is considered an insecure lecay method. Authorization code flow . Client gets an authorization code back as a request parameter embedded in the url. The client then uses this code to exchange it for an access token. Usually secure random strings such as state and client secret are used to validate the process. Authorization code flow with PKCE .

Out of the many level curves $f(x,y) = d$ can take, we want to pick the one with maximum or minimum $d$. Since we have a constraint, we can only expand or shrink the curve until it touches the constraint $g(x,y) = c$. There should be a point where both curves become tangent to each other. At this tangent, $f(x,y)$ is at a local extreme while satisfying the constraint. The gradient vector $\\nabla f(x,y)$ is orthogal to its tangent vector, and so is the gradient vector $\\nabla g(x,y)$ to its tangent vector. Although they may be in opposite directions and/or different magnitudes, both gradient vectors are aligned. In the figure above, they are the blue dotted line vector and the red line vector at the tangent point facing opposite directions.

And our alternative hypothesis: . $$ H_A: \\mu \\ne m $$ . If $p &lt; \\alpha$, we would conclude that the population mean is unlikely to be $m$. It is important to note that the value $m$ must be selected so that it serves as a meaningful value to the researcher (there should be a reason why we chose $m$). For example, if we were testing for the population’s average height, there’s no point in just choosing $m = 170cm$, because that’s an arbitrary value. In this case, we are actually better off just calculating a confidence interval for the population mean. However, if there was a better reasoning behind $m = 170cm$ (such as, average height in a certain country was 170cm and we want to test if it is the same in this country), then our hypothesis test would be more meaningful.

Most common case is comparing the data of identical subjects before and after a treatment. This might seem like a new testing method, but it is actually just a special case of one-sample t-test. Instead of setting up a null hypothesis on the population mean, we set up a null hypothesis on the difference between the means before/after. Consider the following table: . | Subject | Before | After | Difference | . | A | 10 | 12 | 2 | . | B | 10 | 14 | 4 | . | C | 12 | 14 | 2 | . | D | 11 | 15 | 4 | . Let $X_0$ be the population of the data before the treatment, and $X_1$ be the population of the data after the treatment. Then our null hypothesis would be on the $\\Delta X = X_1 - X_0$: . $$ H_0: \\mu_{\\Delta X} = 0 $$ . I won’t go into the details of the calculation, but following the same steps as one-sample t-test, you will find that our difference in the table above is significantly different from 0 (with $\\alpha = 0.05$). You may wonder if we can just use a two-sample t-test (described below) to compare the means before/after.

The red dotted line indicates a curve of a random classifier where $TPR = FPR$, which means the number of correctly classfied positive tests and the number of incorrectly classified positive tests are equal. For any classifier above the random classifier, the number of correctly classified positives is greater than the number of incorrectly classified positives. So classifiers with ROC curves higher above have better performances. Area under the curve (AUC) ($\\le 1$) is an aggregate performance measure across all thresholds of a model. Higher AUC indicates higher accuracy of the model. AUC is a useful metric even when the class distributions are highly unbalanced. AUC is for comparing models not thresholds. ",

We instead solve a minimization problem of: . $$ \\begin{gather*} \\min_{\\mathbf{w}, b} \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2 \\quad s.t.\\quad y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b) \\geq 1 \\end{gather*} $$ . We use $\\frac{1}{2} \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2$ instead of $\\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert$ just so that the derivative is easier to calculate. This primal problem can be solved using Lagrange multipliers. Soft margin SVC . In reality, the data are not always linearly separable with a hard margin. We can relax the constraint to allow some mistakes, but instead penalize the misclassification. To account for the misclassifications, we introduce a slack variable $\\xi_i \\ge 0$ for each observation: . $$ \\xi_i \\approx \\max(0, 1 - y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b)) $$ . The right side of the $\\approx$ is called the hinge loss. We use the approximate sign because the slack variable is not exactly the hinge loss, but some constant times the hinge loss. Geometrically, $\\xi_i$ captures the distance from the correct side of the margin defined by the support vectors to the observation, which is an intuitive penalty for misclassification. For correctly classified observations, $\\xi_i = 0$, and for greatly misclassified observations $\\xi_i$ gets bigger. With this slack variable, we now have a new constraint: . \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b &amp;\\geq 1 - \\xi_i &amp; \\text{if } y_i = 1 \\\\ \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b &amp;\\leq -1 + \\xi_i &amp; \\text{if } y_i = -1 \\end{align*}\\] This soft-margin contraint can be compactly written as: . \\[y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i\\] Since now we have two things to minimize, the original objective in addition to the sum of the slack variables, so we solve the following minimization problem: . $$ \\min_{\\mathbf{w}, b, \\xi} \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert \\mathbf{w} \\rVert^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_i \\quad s.t.\\quad y_i (\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}_i + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i $$ . where $C$ is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between having a large, complex model (added $\\xi_i$) and allowing more mistakes. | With a huge $C$, we are essentially solving a hard-margin problem. | Because in attempt to minimize the slack sum with a huge $C$, we will end up allowing slacks of near-zero values which is as rigid as a hard-margin. | . | With a small $C$, we are giving more rooms for slack during the minimization. | .

    "content": "Another way to solve non-linearly separable classifications is to use the kernel trick to transform the data. Commonly used method to solve non-linearly separable classifications is to use the kernel trick in conjunction with the soft-margin SVC. Let feature map $\\Phi$ be a non-linear transformation that maps the data from a lower-dimensional input space to a higher-dimensional feature space. $$ \\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^q \\quad \\text{where}\\quad q &gt; p $$ . Cover's theorem Cover’s theorem states that a linearly non-separable dataset in a lower-dimensional space may be linearly separable in a higher-dimensional space. Kernel $K(\\cdot)$ is a function that satisfies the following: . $$ K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_i)^T \\Phi(\\mathbf{x}_j) \\quad \\forall \\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j \\in \\mathbb{R}^p $$ . In other words, the kernel function is a function that given any two vectors in the input space, computes the dot product of them in the feature space. Loose intuition In the usual input space, the optimal solution given by the Lagrange multiplier method involves calculating the dot product of the observations $\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\mathbf{x}_j$. Since we now inflate the input space to a higher-dimensional feature space, we need to calculate the dot product of the observations in the feature space. So in order to replace the inner product of inputs, we need to find a kernel that can compute the dot product of the observations in the feature space for all possible pairs of observations. One key point is that as long as we can find a kernel with output that lives in the inner product space, we don’t have to have an explicitly defined feature map $\\Phi$. Radial basis function (RBF) kernel . Most commonly used kernel for SVC is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. The RBF kernel is defined as: . \\[K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\exp \\left( -\\frac{\\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j \\rVert^2}{2 \\sigma^2} \\right)\\] $\\sigma$ is a free variable that controls the flexibility of the decision boundary. Oftentimes, we define . \\[\\gamma = \\frac{1}{2 \\sigma^2}\\] Again, $\\frac{1}{2}$ in the denominator is just for convenience. You may find $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$ in other sources. so that the RBF kernel is defined as: . $$ K(\\mathbf{x}_i, \\mathbf{x}_j) = \\exp \\left( -\\gamma \\lVert \\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j \\rVert^2 \\right) $$ . | Low $\\gamma$: decision boundary is less flexible, more linear | High $\\gamma$: decision boundary is more flexible | .

What we do is try to fit a hyperplane that minimizes the residuals, while allowing some slack. In soft margin SVC, we had the hinge loss to define the slack variable.

The &lt;name-of-env&gt; can be anything you like, but venv is used the most by convention. Just like node_modules, because venv exists within the project root, it is almost always added to .gitignore. Activate environment .

For example if you’re running a DB as a container without a volume mapped, each time the container restarts, the contents of the DB will be erased.
